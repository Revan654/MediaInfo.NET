Right-click to show the context menu and choose Install to register common file associations, File Explorer will then show a MediaInfo menu item in the context menu. For custom file extensions use [Open with++](https://github.com/stax76/OpenWithPlusPlus).

On a 32-Bit system download the DLL from the MediaInfo website, only the 64-Bit DLL is included.
